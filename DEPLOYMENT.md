#### 1. Playing locally (Installing MongoDB)

First, you will need to install and run [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) in another terminal instance and create a folder /data/db/ in the root drive (windows)

To run MongoDB: 
```bash
$ mongod
```
Or on windows, run mongod.exe


#### 2. After you've installed MongoDB, clone the repository of the project and install the dependencies.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Angulz/showroom-back.git
$ cd showroom-back
$ npm install
```

#### 3. Run the server in development mode

```bash
$ npm run dev
Express server listening on http://0.0.0.0:9000, in development mode
```
